#Problem#

Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College.
One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

#Solution#

def average(array):
    
    a = set(array)
    avg = sum(a)/len(a)
    return avg
    

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = average(arr)
    print(result)
