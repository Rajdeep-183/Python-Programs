#Problem#

You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports.
For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.
Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.


#Solution#

def solve(s):
    ans = s.split(' ')
    ans1 = (i.capitalize() for i in ans)
    return  ' '.join(ans1)



if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    s = input()

    result = solve(s)



#Approach#

1. The first thing we did was splitting the string by spaces and storing it in ans variable.
2. The Capitalize method in Python converts first letter in capital while leave others in small so what we did is used a for loop with capitalize function
so it will convert all of their first letters in capital.
3. We returned join method to join the resulting string with spaces and the resulting string will have first letter capital.
