#Problem#

In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers, n and m. 
There are  words, which might repeat, in word group A. There are  words belonging to word group B.
For each m words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not. Print the indices of each occurrence of m in group A. If it does not appear, print -1.


#Solution#

from collections import defaultdict
n,m = map(int, input().split())
d = defaultdict(list)

for i in range(n):
    ans1 = input()
    d[ans1].append(i+1)
    
    
for j in range(m):
    ans2 = input()
    
    if ans2 in d:
        print(*d[ans2])
    else:
        print(-1)
