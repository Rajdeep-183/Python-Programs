collection = list(map(int, input("Enter the numbers separated by spaces\n").split()))
# Input a set of integer items separated by spaces

key = int(input("Enter the key to be found\n"))
# Enter the element to be found

for i in range(len(collection)):
    if collection[i] == key:
        print(key,'found at',i+1,'position')
        break
else:   
    print(key,'not found in the input collection')
            
# Approach to be followed
'''
We used For loop to iterate inside the collection variable
the range for iteration will be from 0 to upto the lenth of the collection variable
We used if statement to check whether the key is equal to any item in the collection
If the key is present then we get our desired statement with the position of the item and break statement takes the control out from the loop
If the key is not found then else part will be executed
