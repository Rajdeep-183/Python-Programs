#Problem#

Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given n scores.
Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

Input Format

The first line contains n. The second line contains an array Arr[] of n integers each separated by a space.

Output Format

Print the runner-up score.


#Solution#

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = map(int, input().split())
    
    m = set(arr)
    
    b = sorted(m)
    
    print(b[-2])


#Approach:
The set function converts the array into a set 
Set can store only unique elements
Then we use the sorted function to sort it
for the runner-up score we can print the last second element
