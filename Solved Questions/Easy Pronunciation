Question:

Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like "schtschurowskia", are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.

We say that a word is hard to pronounce if it contains 
4
4 or more consonants in a row; otherwise it is easy to pronounce. 
For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce, but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.

You are given a string 
S
S consisting of 
N
N lowercase Latin characters. Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above â€” print YES if it is easy to pronounce and NO otherwise.

Solution:

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    vowel = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = 0 
    hard = False
    for x in s:
        if x not in vowel:
            c += 1
            if c >= 4:
                hard = True
                break
        
        else:
            c = 0
            
            
    if hard:
        print('no')
    else:
        print('yes')
